The following talk was part of a panel discussion at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin for the Opening Days of the European Month of Photography (EMOP) in October 2020, in cooperation with ECCHR.

In this episode, Fred Ritchin (USA), photographer and Dean Emeritus of the International Center of Photography School, discusses the role graphic images have had in photojournalism to raise political awareness. For this purpose, he looks to some of recent history’s most iconic examples.

Ritchin unpacks widely-held ideas about documentary truth, examining how photography can shine light on violence and repression, while also questioning the ways in which this transmission might be limited.

The following talk was part of a panel discussion at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin for the Opening Days of the European Month of Photography (EMOP) in October 2020, in cooperation with ECCHR.

Join us for a talk from Susan Meiselas (USA), documentary photographer and president of the Magnum Foundation, about her practice, including her experiences as a photojournalist covering human rights issues in Central America, beginning with the popular insurrection in Nicaragua 1978 and her six-year long project creating a photographic history of Kurdistan.

Meiselas addresses the ethical responsibility of photographers as witnesses: what evidence should be made visible, who is it for and who does it serve? What responsibility do photographers have towards those affected? Where does the evidential work to document a process begin and end?

Please be advised, this episode contains themes of violence that some listeners may find distressing.

In their interweaving stories, Salazar Jimenéz chronicles sexual and gender-based violence suﬀered by countless women at the hands of both the Peruvian authorities and members of Shining Path.

Salazar Jimenéz and Theurer will discuss the enduring consequences of gender discrimination and using fiction as a tool for visibility and for sensitizing us to the suﬀering of others.

We’ll begin with an excerpt from the novel, read by Salazar Jeminéz herself. Please be advised, this episode contains themes of sexual and gender-based violence that some listeners may find distressing.

Today, Guatemalan visual artist Ixmucané Aguilar discusses with Wolfgang Kaleck her documentary photography practice exploring the enduring effects of German colonialism in Namibia and the genocide against the Herero and Nama. Anchored in different Namibian regions, and often based on portraits, narratives, poems, and lamentations, Aguilar’s work draws from the anthropologist’s playbook, working with oral histories from living descendants as much as archival sources. The conversation addresses the fragility of photography as a medium, the risk the photographer runs of imposing their values upon their subject, the importance of collective evidence and recognizing the many nuances of truth.
